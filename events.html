                <p>GloRilla is a Grammy-nominated musician and award-winning hip-hop artist from the North Memphis neighborhood of Frayser, Tennessee. GloRilla has been savoring the success of her summer takeover, considering her three hit songs - "TGIF," "Yeah! Glo" and "Wanna Be (feat Megan Thee Stallion)" each spent time on Top-40 of the Billboard Hot 100. At one point, all 3 songs charted simultaneously in the Top-40, resulting in GloRilla becoming the first female hip-hop artist to achieve the feat in 2024.

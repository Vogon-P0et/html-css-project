# Event Center Website Project

### Description
This event center is a bit of a representation of Jacksonville, Fl with the location of the event center on the shores of Atlantic and Neptune Beach. The events are real event dates and times for shows at the VyStar Memorial Arena in Jacksonville [Arena Events](https://arena.jaxevents.com/). This was a challenging project, and I have a pretty solid handle on HTML and CSS after completing it.
